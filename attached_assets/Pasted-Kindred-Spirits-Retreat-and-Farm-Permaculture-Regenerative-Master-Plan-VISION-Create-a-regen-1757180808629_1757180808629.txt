Kindred Spirits Retreat and Farm

Permaculture & Regenerative Master Plan

⸻

VISION

Create a regenerative destination to help people destress from daily life and reconnect with nature through short-term rentals, weekend retreats, and educational experiences. Nestled at the base of the mountains, guests will explore scenic trails by day, enjoy spa services and farm-to-table meals by night, and connect with like-minded people under the stars.

This foundation will grow into a regenerative agriculture food supply and a self-sustaining safe haven for future generations.
